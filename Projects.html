    <p calss="p">This is my Eagle Scout project! This is a magnetic marble track wall I made with friends and helpers for kids at the Piedmont Play School to play with and express creativity! I first modeled the project in Fusion 360 (a computer aided design software). Then I bought and built the magnetic wall with my friends. I also 3D printed the tracks with my friends and used epoxy to hold the magnets in well.</p>

    <p calss="p">This is a picture of the robot that I made with my robotics team Hypercube. Our team competed in the FIRST Tech Challenge robotics competition. When building our robot we first designed our robot in Fusion 360, then ordered parts and machined robot pieces. I used our CNC Machine to mill parts out of aluminum and plastic. Lastly, we coded and tested our robot to play the game. I was the driver of the robot and really enjoy driving the robot in competition along with working with my friends to build it. Robotics has taught me a lot about design and teamwork!</p>
