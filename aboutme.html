        <p>I like to do robotics, read (Series in background is The Stormlight Archive), and play games with with friends among other things. The Stormlight Archive is a book series I read and really enjoyed. Although it is not finished, it is still extremely intresting and worth a read. I live in Piedmont right now and am a senior at Piedmont High School. I will most likely be going to UCSB for college, majoring in computer science! I am excited to take advantage of the opportunities at college and meet new like minded people!</p>
